	A quick and uncluttered way to setup a MVC-like enviroment in PHP
	it consists of packages with different components beneath. 
	Each component can be though of as a controller with corresponding
	views, there is no models as this is only used to create structure
	and it's up to you to fill in the blanks.


	INSTALL    ======================================================

	To install, pull this down to your web server 

	$ git clone https://lafka@github.com/lafka/Wave.git

	Create a link of the index file
	
	$ ln -P Wave/index.php .


	Add the rewrite rules you need:

	# NGINX

	    if ( !-e $request_filename )
	    {
	        rewrite ^/(.*)$ /index.php last;
	    }

		# In your php_fpm call add this:
			fastcgi_param WAVE_ENV production

    # APACHE

        RewriteEngine on
        RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} \.php$ [OR]
        RewriteCond %{DOCUMENT_ROOT}/%{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f 
        RewriteRule . /index.php  [L] 

		# Valid is production,stage,dev - if none is set production is assumed
		SetEnv WAVE_ENV production

                                             
	FIRST STEPS   ======================================================

	Create a new package with some components:

	mkdir -p MyPkg/{Hello,Goodbye}

	Create the router for it	
	
	touch !$/Route.php

	A controller must be in namespace that corelates to the path, so your
	controller would be named \MyPkg\{Hello,Goodbye}\Route. The cont-
	roller would also need to implement \Fwt\Controller\Iface. A stripped
	controller would look something like this:

	namespace MyPkg\Hello;
	use Wave\Route\Iface as RouteInterface, Wave\Route\Regex as RegexRoute;

	class Route extends RegexRoute implements RouteInterface {
	{
		protected $regex = '~/(?hello|good-?day)~i';

		public function dispatch ($uri) {
			echo "Good day to you!";
		}
	}

	This matches all request that starts with hello, good-day or goodday.
