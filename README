	A quick and uncluttered way to setup a MVC-like enviroment in PHP
	it consists of packages with different components beneath. 
	Each component can be though of as a controller with corresponding
	views, there is no models as this is only used to create structure
	and it's up to you to fill in the blanks.


	INSTALL    ======================================================

	To install, pull this down to your web server with the name fwt.

	$ git clone https://lafka@github.com/lafka/Wave.git fwt

	Create a link of the index file
	
	$ ln -P fwt/index.php .


	Add the rewrite rules you need for nginx it could look like this:
	
	    if ( !-e $request_filename )
	    {
	        rewrite ^/(.*)$ /index.php last;
	    }

                                             
	FIRST STEPS   ======================================================

	Create a new package with some components:

	mkdir -p mypkg/{hello,goodbye}

	Create the controller and default view for each of them:
	
	touch !$/{default,controller}.php

	A controller must be in namespace that corelates to the path, so your
	controller would be named \MyPkg\{Hello,Goodbye}\Controller. The cont-
	roller would also need to implement \Fwt\Controller\Iface. A stripped
	controller would look something like this:

	namespace MyPkg\Hello;
	use Fwt\Controller\Abstraction, Fwt\Controller\Iface;

	class Controller extends Abstraction implements Iface
	{
		
	}

	To add a new view you would just need to create the file and it will
	be accessible.
